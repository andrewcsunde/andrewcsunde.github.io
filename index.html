	<p>Disclaimer: This webpage is not owned or run by <em>Guala Co.</em> I am an illustrator who has created and sold a few graphic designs to <em>Guala's</em> brand. If you would like to see visit <em>Guala</em>, and purchase clothing with these designs you can visit their online shop.</p>

		<div class="title">Guala-Bill Title, $40</div>

		<br />

		<p>Welcoming our newest graphic: <em>Guala-Bill Title</em>. This image exhibits the brand name once again, this time completely composed of Guala-bills. This graphic will look great as a small print on both white and black shirts.

		<p>Introducing the <em>Guala Symbol</em>. This figure is designed to be a minimal illustration of the brands vision. It will look great as a large print on a shirt. It could also be displayed alongside another graphic, or apart from the garment's primary print, such as on the nape of the neck or on the sleeve of a shirt.</p>

		<div class="title">Inky Guala Title, $35</div>
		<br />
		<img class="content_image" src="images/inky_title_2000px.png" alt="guala title" />
		<br />

		<p>The <em>Inky Guala Title</em> will look great as a site-header, or as a large print on the front of a shirt or sweater.</p>

		<br />

		<p>So I've made a few <em>titles</em> for your brand now. I will now begin creating more <em>imagery</em>. Here is what you can expect from me soon:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Colourful, minimal graphics suitable for felt/embroidered patches. I will keep the density of detail low in these as well as limit the number of colours so that you are able to order them as patches.</li>
			<li>Detailed fine line drawings suitable for large prints onto white shirts.</li>
			<li>I will continue to focus the theme on cash, and will incorporate the title of your brand into the graphics.</li>
		</ul>
